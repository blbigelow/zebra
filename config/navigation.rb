    # key - a symbol which uniquely defines your navigation item in the scope of the primary_navigation
    # name - will be displayed in the rendered navigation. This can also be a call to your I18n-framework.
    # url - the address that the generated item links to. You can also use url_helpers (named routes, restful routes helper, url_for etc.)
    # options - can be used to specify attributes that will be included in the rendered navigation item (e.g. id, class etc.)
    #
    primary.item :key_1, 'Dashboard', dashboards_path

    # You can also specify a condition-proc that needs to be fullfilled to display an item.

    # thus you can use all the methods and vars you have available in the views.
